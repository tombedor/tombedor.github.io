Like many others, I still mourn the loss of [Google Inbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbox_by_Gmail), perhaps the second most missed product in the [Google Graveyard](https://killedbygoogle.com).

I've made various attempts at replicating the functionality, but have landed on a relatively [simple script](https://github.com/tombedor/inbox). 

Using two labels it creates ("hidden", and "surfaced"), it hides emails in the archive temporarily, and resurfaces them once a day. The pesky unread icon still shows up in the labels tab, but it's the closest I've come to replicating my beloved Inbox setup.
