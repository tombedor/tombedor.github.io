**EMPLOYMENT INFORMATION**


**Block (formerly Square) 							   03/2017 - Present**


**_ML Engineering Manager, Rules Engine					    10/2023 - Present_**


Founded team of 3 engineers to focus on deploying a new rules engine across Block. Used LLM’s to facilitate complex system migrations and support automation.


_Technologies used: _Kotlin, AWS, LLM’s (Autogen, MemGPT, Langchain libraries)


**_ML Engineering Manager, Underwriting and Credit_	**	     	    01/2022 - 10/2023


Lead and founded team of 6 (all internal transfers), responsible for supporting underwriting ML for credit products within CashApp. At present, the team supports 6 credit products with more than $300m in originations/month.


_Key project: Self-service batch ML pipelines_


Built support for self-service ML underwriting decision pipelines. This allowed modelers to quickly build support for 5 new credit products in 18 months, quickly adapting to changing credit risk factors and product requirements.


_Key project: Rules engine vendor_


Identified business rule complexity as a substantial tax on ML modeler productivity. To remedy this, we onboarded a rules engine vendor to Block hosting infrastructure. This required extensive cross-company alignment, with stakeholders from security, hosting/networking, and ML platform teams.


Decreased the time it takes to launch, added workflow testing capabilities, and are currently onboarding more teams to the tool.


_Technologies used_: Kotlin, Python, AWS Cloud.


**_Software Engineer,  Machine Learning Infrastructure_**	 	                     01/2019 - 01/2022


Member of ML platform team responsible for developing, deploying, and monitoring production ML workloads.


_Key project: ML monolith decomposition, ML platforming efforts_


The ML monolith was operated by a team of as little as 3 and was responsible for ML feature gathering, model orchestration, rules, and actioning. Stability was a challenge, and any outages resulted in immediate financial loss.


We identified actioning (e.g. based on an ML evaluation, make an API call to block a payment) as the most operationally problematic component. I was DRI for splitting out fraud, credit, and compliance applications, as well as negotiating ownership to customer teams.


This improved stability for the ML monolith, enabling the platform to onboard new customers. Over 2 years, platform usage grew from 29 distinct integrations to 78.


_Technologies used_: Java, React JS, MySQL, Google Cloud, AWS Cloud.


**_Senior Data Engineer, Data Infrastructure_**			                                    03/2017 - 01/2019


The team was responsible for data warehouse management, data pipelines, and external data ingestion.


_Key project: Snowflake provisioning and permissions system_


As part of a migration from Vertica to Snowflake, I redesigned the data warehouse management layer from scratch. The redesign integrated with the in-house application ACL system. This system:



* Assigned explicit, role based permissions, with expiring audited data sharing requests
* Attributed cost for data warehouse storage and compute
* Continues to run largely intact after 5 years,  scaling from ~3000 users to ~12,000 users and handling several major acquisitions.

_Technologies used: Ruby, Snowflake data warehouse, Vertica data warehouse (on premise), Google Cloud_


**HealthLoop**


**_Software Engineer_							                  **08/2014 – 03/2017


Created data replication pipelines, an internal reporting application, app instrumentation, and user facing dashboard features.
